### Motivations

This project is born as a technical playground to learn Flutter. 

This project does not aim to be revolutionnary or even useful, it's just a simple app for people who love beers.

### Technical details

The app is made with Flutter with the following tech stack:
- Flutter: [https://flutter.io/](https://flutter.io/)
- FlutterFire: [https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/FlutterFire.md](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/FlutterFire.md)
- Sentry.io: [https://sentry.io](https://sentry.io)

The app uses the MVI architecture, the implementation is greatly inspired by [Brian Egan's work](https://gitlab.com/brianegan/flutter_mvi_counter).

### Data provider

Beers data is coming from the [Untappd API](https://untappd.com/api)
